# Automated Data Analysis & Text Tag Extraction  

## Project Overview  
This project automates comprehensive data analysis on CSV datasets, including:  
- Column-wise data inspection  
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies)  
- Identifying critical columns with insights and visualizations  
- Extracting meaningful tags from free-text fields (e.g., customer feedback, repair notes)  
- Providing actionable recommendations based on findings  

## Key Analysis Findings  
1. **Data Distribution & Trends:** Identified key trends in repair costs, most frequent issues, and location-based service variations.  
2. **Common Customer Complaints:** Frequent mentions of **steering, wheel, heating issues, and non-functional components**.  
3. **Repair Action Insights:** Most repairs involve **module replacements** and component fixes, suggesting potential quality concerns.  
4. **Cost Variability:** Some repairs show significantly higher costs due to **repeated failures**.  
5. **Geographical Patterns:** Certain states have higher service demands, indicating **regional performance variations**.  

## Technology Used  
- **Python** (Data Processing & Analysis)  
- **Pandas** (Data Cleaning & Manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  

## Recommendations  
✔ **Preventive Maintenance:** Address common failures (e.g., steering module) before complete breakdown.  
✔ **Quality Improvement:** Investigate repeated component failures and enhance part durability.  
✔ **Optimized Inventory Management:** Stock frequently replaced components based on analysis.  
✔ **Customer Support Insights:** Improve service quality by proactively handling common complaints.
